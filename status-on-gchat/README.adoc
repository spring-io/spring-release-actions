= Notify on Google Chat

Send workflow run notifications to a Google Chat space. Use this action in any GitHub repository to post status, workflow details, and job results when a run completes.

== Requirements

* A Google Chat space with a webhook (add via *Space settings* → *Apps & integrations* → *Webhooks*)
* The workflow must have permission to use `github.token` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) for the `gh run view` API call

== Inputs

|===
| Input | Required | Default | Description
| `gchat-webhook-url` | Yes | — | The Google Chat webhook URL for the space
|===

== Sample usage

=== Notify only on failure (default)

Add a job that runs after your main jobs and calls the action.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # ... your build and test steps ...

  notify:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: always()  # Run even when build fails
    steps:
      - uses: spring-io/spring-release-actions/status-on-gchat@main
        with:
          gchat-webhook-url: ${{ secrets.GCHAT_WEBHOOK_URL }}
----

=== Notify on success

[source,yaml]
----
  notify:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: spring-io/spring-release-actions/status-on-gchat@main
        with:
          gchat-webhook-url: ${{ secrets.GCHAT_WEBHOOK_URL }}
          notify-on: success
----

=== Notify when the build fails

[source,yaml]
----
  notify:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ !success() }}
    steps:
      - uses: spring-io/spring-release-actions/status-on-gchat@main
        with:
          gchat-webhook-url: ${{ secrets.GCHAT_WEBHOOK_URL }}
----

Store the webhook URL as a repository or organization secret (e.g. `GCHAT_WEBHOOK_URL`) so it is not committed to the repo.

== Sample output

The message posted to Google Chat uses plain text with link markup. Examples:

In Google Chat, the angle-bracket links render as clickable links (e.g. the run title links to the Actions run, workflow name to the workflow page, and each job to its job log).
